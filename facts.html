          SARS-CoV-2 is the name of this specific strand of coronavirus and is
          the third novel coronavirus to emerge in this century. This causes
          COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). It was first spotted in December
          2019 and was declared a global pandemic in March 2020.

          Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, chills, coughing, difficulty of
          breathing, fatigue, headache, sore throat, nausea, and new loss of

          COVID-19 is primarily spread from person to person and you can become
          infected by coming into close contact (6 feet) with a person who has
          COVID-19.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is possible to also get infected by touching a surface or item that
          has the virus on it, and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.
          <br />
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, but you can seek medical
          care to help relieve your symptoms.

          Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical
          conditions may be at higher risk for more severe illness.
